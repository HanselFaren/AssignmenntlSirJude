It was but some few nights ago
    I wandered down this quiet lane;
  I pray that I may never know
    The feelings then I felt, again.
  The leaves were shining all about,
    You might almost have seen them springing;
  I heard the cuckoo’s simple shout,
    And all the little birds were singing.
  It was not dull, the air was clear,
    All lovely sights and sounds to deal,
  My eyes could see, my ears could hear,
    Only my heart, it would not feel;
  And yet that it should not be so,
    My mind kept telling me within;
  Though nought was wrong that I did know,
    I thought I must have done some sin.
  For I am sure as I can be,
    That they who have been wont to look
  On all in Nature’s face they see,
    Even as in the Holy Book;
  They who with pure and humble eyes
    Have gazed and read her lessons high,
  And taught their spirits to be wise
    In love and human sympathy,—
  That they can soon and surely tell
    When aught has gone amiss within,
  When the mind is not sound and well,
    Nor the soul free from taint of sin.
  For as God’s Spirit from above,
    So Beauty is to them below,
  And when they slight that holy love,
    Their hearts that presence may not know.
  So I turned home the way I came,
    With downcast looks and heavy heart,
  A guilty thing and full of shame,
    With a dull grief that had no smart.
  It chanced when I was nearly there
    That all at once I raised my eyes—
  Was it a dream, or vision rare,
    That then they saw before them rise?
  I see it now, before me here,
    As often, often I have done,
  As bright as it could then appear,
    All shining in the setting sun.
  Elms, with their mantling foliage spread,
    And tall dark poplars rising out,
  And blossomed orchards, white and red,
    Cast, like a long low fence, about;
  And in the midst the grey church-tower,
    With one slight turret at its side,
  Bringing to mind with silent power
    Those thousand homes the elm-trees hide.
  And then there came the thought of one
    Who on his bed of sickness lay,
  Whilst I beneath the setting sun
    Was dreaming this sweet hour away.
  I thought of hearts for him that beat,
    Of aching eyes their watch that kept;
  The sister’s and the mother’s seat—
    And oh! I thought I should have wept.
  And oh! my spirit melted then,
    The weight fell off me that I bore,
  And now I felt in truth again
    The lovely things that stood before.
  O blessed, blessed scene, to thee,
    For that thy sweet and softening power,
  I could have fallen upon my knee,
    Thy stately elms, thy grey church-tower.
  So then I took my homeward way,
    My heart in sweet and holy frame,
  With spirit, I may dare to say,
    More good and soft than when I came.

  1836
Twas on a sunny summer day
    I trod a mighty city’s street,
  And when I started on my way
    My heart was full of fancies sweet;
  But soon, as nothing could be seen,
  But countenances sharp and keen,
  Nought heard or seen around but told
  Of something bought or something sold,
  And none that seemed to think or care
  That any save himself was there,—

  Full soon my heart began to sink
    With a strange shame and inward pain,
  For I was sad within to think
    Of this absorbing love of gain,
  And various thoughts my bosom tost;
  When suddenly my path there crossed,
  Locked hand in hand with one another,
  A little maiden and her brother—
  A little maiden, and she wore
  Around her waist a pinafore.

  And hand in hand along the street
    This pretty pair did softly go,
  And as they went, their little feet
    Moved in short even steps and slow:
  It was a sight to see and bless,
  That little sister’s tenderness;
  One hand a tidy basket bore
  Of flowers and fruit—a chosen store,
  Such as kind friends oft send to others—
  And one was fastened in her brother’s.

  It was a voice of meaning sweet,
    And spake amid that scene of strife
  Of home and homely duties meet,
    And charities of daily life;
  And often, should my spirit fail,
  And under cold strange glances quail,
  ’Mid busy shops and busier throng,
  That speed upon their ways along
  The thick and crowded thoroughfare,
  I’ll call to mind that little pair.
